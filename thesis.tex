\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Biological visualization and illustration}
\section{Motivation}
For this project we focused on providing better tools for scientific illustrators. The idea was to bridge software that they are used to (represented by Maya) and software that brings modern rendering abilities to the domain of molecular rendering (represented by CellVIEW).
Emphasize the difference between offline and realtime rendering.

\chapter{Overview of the two programs that I'm going to be bridging - TODO better title}
Here I will talk about in which context are these two 'systems' used and what is each for.
\section{CellVIEW}
Briefly describe what CellVIEW is about. Give links to the papers that are describing CellVIEW and those that are using it.
\subsection{Unity}
I don't know if this is needed. I could just go little bit into detail of why is Unity good (which is funny now that we are probably going away from it)
\section{Maya}
Point to examples of animations that are produced with Maya.

\chapter{Suggested solution}
I have introduced the field. I have sketched the problem that we are trying to solve (improving the workflow of animators/illustrators). Now it's time to describe the suggested solution.

\chapter{Implementation details}
\section{WinAPI}
\section{Maya side}
Topics - Architecture of the plugin, what parts/classes of API are used, memory layout, what I tried and didn't work.
\section{Unity side}
Topics - Architecture of the plugin, very generally about plugins (it's just a basic C++ dll plugin), interface between C++ and C\#
\chapter{Future work}
What optimizations I could implement, how it could be used and what would be needed to implemented for that.

\appendix %% Start the appendices.
\chapter{An appendix}
Here you can insert the appendices of your thesis.
